    "# End-to-End Multi-class Dog Breed Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook builds an end-to-end multi-class image classifier using TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The task is to develop a multi-class image classifier specifically tailored for identifying the breed of dogs from input images. Given a dataset containing images of various dog breeds, the challenge is to create an efficient deep learning-based image classification model capable of accurately categorizing each image into one of the predefined breed classes. The primary objective is to address the complexities associated with intra-class variations, such as differences in color, size, and morphology among different breeds, while also handling challenges such as occlusion and varying image resolutions. The model should be optimized for high classification accuracy, with a focus on minimizing false positives and false negatives. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used in this notebook is from Kaggle's dog breed identification competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation is a file with prediction probabilities for each dog breed of each test image.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 4. Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Some information about the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The input data is in form of images (unstructured data).\n",
    "* There are 120 breeds of dog (this means that there is 120 different classes).\n",
    "* There are 10,223 images in the trainng set (these images have labels).\n",
    "* There are 10,358 images in the test set (these images have no labels)."
